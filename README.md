Experimetnal Design Comparative Analaysis

Getting Started:
The research makes use of the following code written by others (see Acknowledgments)
Groundwater model: SAT2D
Genetic Algorithm (GA): GAlib
Patricle Swarm Optimization (PSO): SwarmOps
LAPACK: LAPACK++

Installation (for Windows)
Note: SAT2D, GAlib, and SwarmOps require their own installation process
A Makefile is included to compile the GA experimental design program
A Visual Studios Projet is included to compile the PSO experimental design program
