Experimetnal Design Comparative Analaysis

Getting Started:
The code and datasets here were used in the research submitted to Water Resources Research (WRR). 
The research makes use of the following code written by others (see Acknowledgments)
Groundwater model: SAT2D
Genetic Algorithm (GA): GAlib
Patricle Swarm Optimization (PSO): SwarmOps

Installation (for Windows)
Note: SAT2D, GAlib, and SwarmOps require their own installation process
A Makefile is included to compile the GA experimental design program
A Visual Studios Projet is included to compile the PSO experimental design program
